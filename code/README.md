# Characterizing the Dynamics, Reactivity, and Controllability of Moods in Depression with a Kalman Filter

This project includes MATLAB scripts for modeling mood time series and Python notebooks for preparing data and analyzing dynamic and control parameter estimates.

## MATLAB Folder: Modeling the Mood Time Series Using a Kalman Filter
- **em/**: MATLAB scripts for expectation maximization inference by estimating latent states and parameters alternately.
- **fit_empirical_data/**: MATLAB scripts for fitting the Kalman filter on empirical mood time series.
- **simulation/**: MATLAB scripts for running simulations using the Kalman filter.
- **auxiliary/**: Auxiliary MATLAB scripts.

## Cluster Folder: MATLAB Code Adapted for Local Cluster Execution

## Python Folder: Preparation and Analysis of Mood Time Series Data

The Python folder contains Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific task.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Conda installed. You can create the necessary environment using the provided `environment.yml` file.

## Data Access

Please note that only one of the three datasets is publicly available.
